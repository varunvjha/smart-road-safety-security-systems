# Fraudulent Licence Plate Recognition

Detecting licence plates using OpenALPR and OpenCV Libraries to locate the license plate in each frame and to detect the moving vehicle license plate number, and checking with our database whether the Licence Plate gets a match in our database or not. If it is present in the Database, the plate is not fraudulent, otherwise the licence plate is fraudulent and it creates an alert.

The moving vehicle is tracked & segmented from the background to narrow down the search region of ALPR. The code is written in python and easy to use in windows & Linux but tested with Windows only.


##### It is still a work in progress right now
